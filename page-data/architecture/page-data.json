Design, architect and sizing a CP4i configuration that supports client requirements for Non-Prod & Production integration workload usage.\n\n  - Students can bring a **Live Client Example** for the workshop.  Or students can use the **fictious example** client scenario.\n\n  - The client is evaluating options for adopting an **Agile Integration** and **cloud-native development** practice that take advantage of containers and a container orchestration platform.\n\n  - Client has an **existing investment** in IBM s/w, one **PoC goal** is to evaluate strategies to re-factor this investment.\n\n  - The client has had some preliminary exposer and concerns wrt the CP4i platform.  They do have a few observations and concerns that they would like to evaluate.  <<< <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/e8301tn9b9tah65f8om2zvwm317wuflw\">Client Background with CP4i Experience</a> >>>.\n\n  - IBM is competitive with **MuleSoft** in this PoC.\n\n  - Not all required information or requirements will be available at this time.
