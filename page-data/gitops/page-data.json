Advise client on the potential advantages of using GitOps automation to accelerate time-to-value for client PoCs, general Cloud Pak adoption, CP4i deployment, and Day-2 operations.\n  - Advise client on the potential advantage for adoption a middleware containerization strategy that is augmented with GitOps automation.\n  - Develop assets and skills to create and maintain you own set of demo environments, demo assets, demo scripts, and automation scripts.\n\n***\n\n## Deliverables\n\n  - Capture a screen shot of your final progress with this Lab. <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/g58y3gae75va4y32726rnk6uyyx5a9ei\" target=\"_blank\">Upload Screen Shots Here Please</a>.\n\n  -
