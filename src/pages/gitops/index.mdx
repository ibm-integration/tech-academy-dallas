## Synopsis

  1. Advise client on the use of modern Agile Integration techniques and methods that utilize RHOCP GitOps & RHCOCP Pipeline automation.
  2. Advise client on the potential advantages of using GitOps automation to accelerate time-to-value for client PoCs, general Cloud Pak adoption, CP4i deployment, and Day-2 operations.
  3. Advise client on the potential advantage for adoption a middleware containerization strategy that is augmented with GitOps automation.
  4. Develop assets and skills to create and maintain you own set of demo environments, demo assets, demo scripts, and automation scripts.

## Goals

  - Attendees will learn an IBM opinionated point of view regarding a GitOps centric method to manage RHOCP infrastructure, IBM integration software and application workload code (three tier GitOps architecture).

  - Attendees will review and extend GitOps automation capabilities to incapsulate key software components within the IBM Integration portfolio.

  - Attendees will compete a hands-on workshop exercise that will deepen their understanding of the IBM GitOps Automation Framework with a specific emphasis on IBM Integration software offerings.

  - Attendees will learn how to position a GitOps automation framework as a key boot-strapping and operational mechanism supporting a Client PoC activity.

  - Attendees will learn how to position and demonstrates a GitOps automation solution as a competitive differentiator to MuleSoft.Â

## Guidelines

  1. **Client Facing**:  Consider the useability or practicality for using this framework to support an IBM Integration sales opportunity.
     - a) Easier option for a Tech Seller to create and deliver a client facing demo.
     - b) Potential to accelerate the time and effort required to get a PoC up and running.
     - c) Communicate the extended value of RHOP as part of an IBM Integration transaction.
     - d) Demonstration of the power of containers, container orchestration, operators, DevSecOps automation, and Day-2 operations.

  2. **Internal**:  Can this framework enable the Technical Sales Professional to be more efficient and effective in the field?
     - a) Will this asset make it easier to have a demo environment up and running and scale-able to accept release updates?
     - b) Will this asset make it easier for a Tech Seller to have their own, self managed demo configuration?
     - c) Will this asset make it easier for a Tech Seller to embrace containers, orchestration, and DevOps principles?
