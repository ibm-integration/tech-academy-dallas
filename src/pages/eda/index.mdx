## Synopsis

  – Advise the Client on the use of Event-Driven/Near Real-time Integration Patterns, Technologies and Implementation Strategies. 

  - Students will have the opportunity to complete an end-to-end, well scripted demo, can be used to highlight some of the key features and functionality of the IBM Event Streams offering running in CP4i

  - Students will have the opportunity to follow a more complex, less scripted, demo experience that will result in the creation of a near real-time inventory management system (MVP).
    - Solution design.
    - KStreams API implementation
    - GitOps deployment with Day-2 operations.

  - In this session you will learn how to use event-driven / near real-time integration patterns and technologies to develop a simple streaming MVP application.

## Deliverables

  - Capture a screen shot of your final progress with this Lab. <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/164731027772?s=27nu5hrsiotjgefurj3v09oz7meo7hrd">Upload Screen Shots Here Please</a>.

## Goals

  - Develop a core understanding of the main components that make up the IBM Events Stream offering.

  - Develop an extended body of knowledge and a deeper understand of key event-driven use cases, event-drive architecture patterns, and near real-time integration patterns.

  - Develop knowledge and skills that can be used to explain how an event-driven integration approach can be used to solve a client’s IT and business goals.

  - Develop skills that can be used to assess a set of client requirements or PoC goals and propose an event-driven solution approach.

  - Complete a hands-on workshop exercise focused on EDA concepts, design patterns.

  - Establish an initial point of view for adopting GitOps methods and practices for event streams implementations.

## Guidelines

  - This session was designed with the recognition that not every student will have the same level of knowledge of IBM Event Streams or event-driven architecture.

  - This session was designed with **two (2) entry points** or tracks that a student can follow depending on skill level.
    - *Beginner Journey*:  This Journey is an entry level starting point and offers a **Demonstration Event Stream from A to Z** experience.  This option offers a well scripted demo flow that covers all key aspects of IBM Event Streams on CP4i.
    - *Advanced Journey*:  This Journey 2 is a more advanced entry point and covers a **full body of knowledge** within the near real-time / event driven architecture domain.  This Journey will have four (4) labs that progressively build out an MVP prototype supporting DoU defined goals and objectives.

  - Students are **free to choose** their entry point for the Tech Academy lab work.

  - Between Journey 1 and Journey 2 there may be **more content to cover** then can be completed in this 4-hour session.  With that in mind, consider using this material as an **on-going learning activity** post Academy.
