## Synopsis

  1. This is a PoC **simulation exercise**.  Design, architect and sizing a CP4i configuration that supports client requirements for Non-Prod & Production integration workload usage.
  2. Students can bring a **Live Client Example** for the workshop.  Or students can use the **fictious example** client scenario.
  3. The client is evaluating options for adopting an **Agile Integration** and **cloud-native development** practice that take advantage of containers and a container orchestration platform.
  4. Client has an **existing investment** in IBM s/w, one **PoC goal** is to evaluate strategies to re-factor this investment.
  5. The client has had some preliminary exposer and concerns wrt the CP4i platform.  They do have a few observations and concerns that they would like to evaluate.  <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/e8301tn9b9tah65f8om2zvwm317wuflw" target="_blank">Client Background with CP4i Experience</a>.
  6. IBM is competitive with **MuleSoft** in this PoC.
  7. Not all required information or requirements will be available at this time.  Document any open issues or additional information required in the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/kjgq175mvpr36bigr1u3u0g1558mrr43" target="_blank">Architecture Decisions</a> artifact.

## Deliverables

  1. Create key <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/kjgq175mvpr36bigr1u3u0g1558mrr43">Architecture Diagrams</a> that Illustrate the core elements of the proposed solution. This could include any of the following work product types (these are suggestions only).
     1. Architecture Overview Diagram(s)
     2. Network Diagrams
     3. Topology Diagrams
     4. System Context Diagram

  2. <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/5kz0q0e33hfrlr5s9rgxlne6ixnbgd1u">Architecture Decisions</a> and key assumptions document

  3. Sizing and Entitlement Calculation Estimates.

  4. Completive Talking Points and Key Design Points to Debunk MuleSoft

  5. Suggested Next Steps, Action Items and Milestones Outline

## Goals

  1. Develop deeper skills at assessing a complex client scenario, with complex requirements, with a focus on capturing key design points, architecture decisions and deployment preparation.  

  2. Develop deeper skills focused on RHOCP cluster design recommendations, CP4i design, component design, workload placement recommendations and sizing recommendations.

  3. Developer deeper skills for documenting a set of solution design artifacts which describe the proposed solution (i.e., Architecture Overview Diagram (AoD), Context Diagrams, Topology Views, Architecture Decisions document).  <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/164383017863?s=kjgq175mvpr36bigr1u3u0g1558mrr43">Templates & Examples Can Be Found Here</a>.

  4. Develop deeper skills for using the IBM Sales Configurator platform, or other sizing tools, to estimate CP4i licensing entitlement.

  5. Harvest asset examples, best practices and repeating design issues. Community Driven. <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/1ysnbuk60rb5lbn1dnsfp522c3ll2xpe">Place your work products here</a>.  Locate your Team Number sub-folder.

## Guidelines

  1. This is a teaming exercise.  Students will work in **groups of five (5)**.

  2. We are asking that Team put in a **total of ~8 hours** of effort on the assignment.  4 hours at Tech Academy and ~4 hours Teaming work after the Tech Academy.

  3. Submit your deliverables **5 business days** after Tech Academy (**June 23**).

  4. Proctors will review each submission and will **provide feedback**.

  5. Each team will be **evaluated** on the following <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/kwney7x4biw112buk9d2tu5rxnw9051k">Scorecard criteria</a>.  **A passing grade is 75%**.

  6. Top asserts will be **harvested** for future use and reuse.

  7. Client is looking to refactor their IBM investment into a modern, container based, operating environment.

  8. Bring your own client scenario or use the Instructor provided scenario.
