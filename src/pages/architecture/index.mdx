## Synopsis

  – This is a PoC **simulation exercise**.  Design, architect and sizing a CP4i configuration that supports client requirements for Non-Prod & Production integration workload usage.

  - Students can bring a **Live Client Example** for the workshop.  Or students can use the **fictious example** client scenario.

  - The client is evaluating options for adopting an **Agile Integration** and **cloud-native development** practice that take advantage of containers and a container orchestration platform.

  - Client has an **existing investment** in IBM s/w, one **PoC goal** is to evaluate strategies to re-factor this investment.

  - The client has had some preliminary exposer and concerns wrt the CP4i platform.  They do have a few observations and concerns that they would like to evaluate.  <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/e8301tn9b9tah65f8om2zvwm317wuflw" target="_blank">Client Background with CP4i Experience</a>.

  - IBM is competitive with **MuleSoft** in this PoC.

  - Not all required information or requirements will be available at this time.  Document any open issues or additional information required in the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/kjgq175mvpr36bigr1u3u0g1558mrr43" target="_blank">Architecture Decisions</a> artifact.

## Deliverables

  – Create key <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/kjgq175mvpr36bigr1u3u0g1558mrr43">Architecture Diagrams</a> that Illustrate the core elements of the proposed solution. This could include any of the following work product types (these are suggestions only).
    - Architecture Overview Diagram(s)
    - Network Diagrams
    - Topology Diagrams
    - System Context Diagram

  - <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/5kz0q0e33hfrlr5s9rgxlne6ixnbgd1u">Architecture Decisions</a> and key assumptions document

  - Sizing and Entitlement Calculation Estimates.

  - Completive Talking Points and Key Design Points to Debunk MuleSoft

  - Suggested Next Steps, Action Items and Milestones Outline

## Goals

  - Develop deeper skills at assessing a complex client scenario, with complex requirements, with a focus on capturing key design points, architecture decisions and deployment preparation.  

  - Develop deeper skills focused on RHOCP cluster design recommendations, CP4i design, component design, workload placement recommendations and sizing recommendations.

  - Developer deeper skills for documenting a set of solution design artifacts which describe the proposed solution (i.e., Architecture Overview Diagram (AoD), Context Diagrams, Topology Views, Architecture Decisions document).  <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/164383017863?s=kjgq175mvpr36bigr1u3u0g1558mrr43">Templates & Examples Can Be Found Here</a>.

  - Develop deeper skills for using the IBM Sales Configurator platform, or other sizing tools, to estimate CP4i licensing entitlement.

  - Harvest asset examples, best practices and repeating design issues. Community Driven. <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/1ysnbuk60rb5lbn1dnsfp522c3ll2xpe">Place your work products here</a>.  Locate your Team Number sub-folder.

## Guidelines

  - This is a teaming exercise.  Students will work in **groups of five (5)**.

  - We are asking that Team put in a **total of ~8 hours** of effort on the assignment.  4 hours at Tech Academy and ~4 hours Teaming work after the Tech Academy.

  - Submit your deliverables **5 business days** after Tech Academy (**June 23**).

  - Proctors will review each submission and will **provide feedback**.

  - Each team will be **evaluated** on the following <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/kwney7x4biw112buk9d2tu5rxnw9051k">Scorecard criteria</a>.  **A passing grade is 75%**.

  - Top asserts will be **harvested** for future use and reuse.

  - Client is looking to refactor their IBM investment into a modern, container based, operating environment.

  - Bring your own client scenario or use the Instructor provided scenario.
